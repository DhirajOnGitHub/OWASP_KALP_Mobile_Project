						<b>OWASP</b> is an online open-content collaborative project, that is, a voluntary association of individuals and groups who are developing a common resource of human knowledge. 
						The structure of the project allows anyone with an Internet connection and World Wide Web browser to alter its content.
						Please be advised that nothing found here has necessarily been reviewed by professionals with the expertise required to provide you with complete, accurate or reliable information.

						That is not to say that you will not find valuable and accurate information in OWASP; much of the time you will.
						However, <b>OWASP cannot guarantee the validity of the information found here. </b>
						The content of any given article may recently have been changed, vandalized or altered by someone whose opinion does not correspond with the state of knowledge in the relevant fields.

						<h4>No formal peer review</h4><p style="color:#000; text-align:justify;">						
						We are working on ways to select and highlight reliable versions of articles. Our active community of editors uses tools such as the Special:Recentchanges and Special:Newpages feeds to monitor new and changing content. 
						However, OWASP is not uniformly peer reviewed; while readers may correct errors or engage in casual peer review, they have no legal duty to do so and thus all information read here is without any implied warranty of fitness for any purpose or use whatsoever. 
						Even articles that have been vetted by informal peer review or featured article processes may later have been edited inappropriately, just before you view them.
