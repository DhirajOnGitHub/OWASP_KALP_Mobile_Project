OWASP is not affiliated with any technology company, although we support the informed use of commercial security technology. Similar to many open-source software projects, OWASP produces many types of materials in a collaborative, open way.  
					</p><p>The OWASP Foundation is the non-profit entity that ensures the project’s long-term success. Almost everyone associated with OWASP is a volunteer, including the OWASP Board, Global Committees, Chapter Leaders, Project Leaders, and project members. We support innovative security research with grants and infrastructure.

					<h6>Welcome to the OWASP Top Ten 2003</h6>
							<div class="decoration"></div>
							<p>The OWASP Top Ten provides a powerful awareness document
								for web application security. The OWASP Top Ten represents a
								broad consensus about what the most critical web application
								security flaws are. Project members include a variety of
								security experts from around the world who have shared their
								expertise to produce this list. There are currently versions in
								English, French, Japanese, and Korean. A Spanish version is in
								the works. We urge all companies to adopt this awareness
								document within their organization and start the process of
								ensuring that their web applications do not contain these flaws.
								Adopting the OWASP Top Ten is perhaps the most effective first
								step towards changing the software development culture within
								your organization into one that produces secure code.</p>

					<h6>What is in OWASP Top10 2003? </h6>
				<div class="decoration"></div>
				<p>	
				The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is dedicated to helping organizations understand and improve the security of their web applications and web services. This list was created to focus corporations and government agencies on the most serious of these vulnerabilities. Web application security has become a hot topic as companies race to make content and services accessible though the web.  At the same time, hackers are turning their attention to the common weaknesses created by application developers.
</p><p>When an organization puts up a web application, they invite the world to send them HTTP requests. Attacks buried in these requests sail past firewalls, filters, platform hardening, and intrusion detection systems without notice because they are inside legal HTTP requests. Even “secure” websites that use SSL just accept the requests that arrive through the encrypted tunnel without scrutiny. This means that your web application code is part of your security perimeter. As the number, size and complexity of your web applications increases, so does your perimeter exposure.
</p><p>The security issues raised here are not new. In fact, some have been well understood for decades. Yet for a variety of  reasons, major software development projects are still making these mistakes and jeopardizing not only their customers’ security, but also the security of the entire Internet. There is no “silver bullet” to cure these problems.  Today’s assessment and protection technology is improving, but can currently only deal with a limited sub-set of the issues at best. To address the issues described in this document, organizations will need to change their development culture, train developers, update their software development processes, and use technology where appropriate.
</p><p>The OWASP Top Ten is a list of vulnerabilities that require immediate remediation. Existing code should be checked for these vulnerabilities immediately, as these flaws are being actively targeted by attackers. Development projects should address these vulnerabilities in their requirements documents and design, build, and test their applications to ensure that they have not been introduced.  Project managers should include time and budget for application security activities including developer training, application security policy development, security mechanism design and development, penetration testing, and security code review. 
</p><p>We encourage organizations to join the growing list of companies that have adopted the OWASP Top Ten as a minimum standard and are committed to producing web applications that do not contain these vulnerabilities.
</p><p>We have chosen to present this list in a format similar to the highly successful SANS/FBI Top Twenty List in order to facilitate its use and understanding. The SANS list is focused on flaws in particular widely used network and infrastructure products. Because each website is unique, the OWASP Top Ten is organized around particular types or categories of vulnerabilities that frequently occur in web applications. These categories are being standardized in the OASIS Web Application Security (WAS) XML Project.
</p><p>This list represents the combined wisdom of OWASP experts, whose experience includes many years of application security work for governments, financial services, pharmaceuticals and manufacturing, as well as developing tools and technology. This document is designed to introduce the most serious web application vulnerabilities. There are many books and guidelines that describe these vulnerabilities in more detail and provide detailed guidance on how to eliminate them. One such guideline is the OWASP Guide available at http://www.owasp.org.
</p><p>The OWASP Top Ten is a living document. It includes instructions and pointers to additional information useful for correcting these types of security flaws. We update the list and the instructions as more critical threats and more current or convenient methods are identified, and we welcome your input along the way. This is a community consensus document – your experience in fighting attackers and in eliminating these vulnerabilities can help others who come after you. Please send suggestions via e-mail to topten@owasp.org with the subject "OWASP Top Ten Comments.”

								Attackers can potentially use many different paths through your application to do harm to your business or organization. Each of these paths represents a risk that may, or may not, be serious enough to warrant attention. 
								</p>

								<p style="text-align:justify;">
								Sometimes, these paths are trivial to find and exploit and sometimes they are extremely difficult. Similarly, the harm that is caused may range from nothing, all the way through putting you out of business. To determine the risk to your organization, you can evaluate the likelihood associated with each threat agent, attack vector, and security weakness and combine it with an estimate of the technical and business impact to your organization.  Together, these factors determine the overall risk.
